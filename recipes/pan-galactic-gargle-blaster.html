        <p><em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> considers this concoction, invented by ex-President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox, to be the best drink in existence. It says that the effect of drinking one is "like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick." The <em>Guide</em> also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterward.</p>
        <p>The <em>Guide</em> even tells you how you can mix one yourself.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the juice from one bottle of the Ol' Janx Spirit, it says.</li>
            <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V--Oh, that Santraginean seawater, it says. Oh, those Santraginean fish!</li>
            <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).</li>
            <li>Allow four liters of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
            <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odors of the dark Qualactic Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
            <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
            <li>Add an olive.</li>
            <li>Drink...but...very carefully...</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Beeblebrox advises that you should "never drink more than two Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters unless you are a thirty ton mega elephant with bronchial pneumonia." In this, he echoes Christopher Hitchens' axiom about gin martinis--on the whole, observe the same rule as you would with breasts: one is far too few, and three is one too many.</p>
        <p>Humans have tried to recreate the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, either by mimicking its trademark green-gold coloring or its paralyzingly high alcohol content. There are also heated debates over whether the drink should be gin-based or not, and whether the olive is actually important.</p>
        <p>In 1981 George Mercer and Mark Borrill created a fan version that is still served at the Spiders nightclub in Hull, UK. It has been been described as "a combination of a Harvey Wallbanger and a tarantula." The ingredients are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>25 ml vodka</li>
            <li>25 ml Pernod</li>
            <li>25 ml Galliano</li>
            <li>25 ml blackcurrant</li>
            <li>25 ml orange juice</li>
            <li>Enough cider to top up</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mixing instructions are simply: "pour over some ice, stir, and enjoy!"</p>
