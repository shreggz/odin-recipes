        <p><em>A Gift to Young Hosuewives</em> is a classic Russian cookbook written and compiled by Elena Molokhovets. From 1861 to 1917--between the emancipation of the serfs and the start of the Bolshevik Revolution--Molokhovets continually revised the volume, becoming a household name in Russia through the decades. During the Soviet era, her famously over-the-top recipes were simultaneously condemned as a symbol of bourgeois decadence by Communist ideologues and envied by those waiting in bread lines. Today the book, known simply as "Molokhovets," is regarded as a historical record of traditional--if aristocratic--Russian cooking.</p>
        <p>Anton Chekhov parodied her in an early sketch, <em>The Alarm-Clock's Calendar</em>, with a series of absurdly indulgent menus such as this one, an eight-course meal for journalists:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A glass of vodka</li>
            <li>Daily shchi [cabbage soup] and yesterday's kasha</li>
            <li>Two glasses of vodka</li>
            <li>Suckling pig with horseradish</li>
            <li>Three glasses of vodka</li>
            <li>Horseradish, cayenne peper, and soy sauce</li>
            <li>Four glasses of vodka</li>
            <li>Seven bottles of beer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I do not recommend trying this at home unless you are a professional.</p>
